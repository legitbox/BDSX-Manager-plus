# BDSX-Manager
WARNING!!! THIS IS A FORK OF BDSX-Manager-plus


BDSX-Manager-plus is a Python-based GUI wrapper for managing a BDSX Server. It has basic features such as Start, Stop, Restart, Auto-restart, and console output with commands. It also has shortcuts to various files inside the bdsx directory. You can see a player list with options to OP, DeOP, or Kick players.

# Installation

Still working on it

Bdsx Github: https://github.com/bdsx/bdsx

# Other

In the future I want to add other feature such as auto backup and chat management feature. If you have any suggestions or bugs/problems please open an issue.
